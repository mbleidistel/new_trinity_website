<h2>What is Integrated Post and Panel (IPP)?</h2>
The Integrated Post and Panel (IPP) system from Trinity is a new system of construction meeting varied needs. It's fully recyclable and highly pest resistant.
<h3></h3>
<h4>Outstanding Differences</h4>
<img border="0" src="img/1innovation-1.JPG" width="269" height="365" align="left" hspace="13" vspace="10">The patented IPP system combines the strength and beauty of Post and Beam 
construction with the energy efficiency of Polyurethane Structural Insulated 
Panels. This airtight technology delivers sustainable savings and quiet comfort 
using reduced mechanical systems and substantially less energy to heat or cool a 
building. The simplified Post and Beam design and OSB Panel skins use less 
timber and new growth forest resources creating an eco-friendly, recyclable and 
longer lasting building.</span><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Fixed Cost Budgeting</h4>
Every IPP project offers many advantages over traditional framing.<p>You can 
budget and plan with predictable certainty, reducing cost overruns, trade 
delays, overlaps, inaccuracies, errors, material waste and costly downtime. The 
IPP building envelope installs quickly and replaces a spectrum of trades and 
materials. This translates into a larger portion of the project completed in 
less time with airtight accuracy.</p>
<p>As a result, your project runs smoother easing coordination and scheduling 
tasks. Interior and exterior trades can start and finish sooner improving output 
capacity, while simplifying tasks with opportunity for reduced expenses.</div>

<div class="container bloc-sm">
<a name="1System"></a>
<h2>What benefits does the IPP system offer?</h2>
The IPP construction system's use of existing materials is innovative and flexible. Existing designs can easily be adapted to support IPP innovations.
<h3></h3>
<h4>Sustainable Benefits</h4>
Your projects now offer more value
for every consumer dollar spent.
Buyers will realize ongoing benefits.
Supplier rebates, energy saving
initiatives, less operating cost, less
energy use, increased comfort and
safety are immediate benefits.
Extra usable space and a longer life
cycle including a higher resale value
makes investing in an IPP built
home a lasting advantage for many
generations to come.

<h2>What an Integrated Approach Means</h2>

Engineered Natural Timber Designs Integrate with Energy Efficient Insulated
Panels Delivering Multiple Consumer and Builder Benefits.

<h3></h3>
<h4>Building Envelopes Deliver Sustainability</h4>
Smart, Fast, Easier, Economical, Strong, Durable, Beautiful, Eco-Friendly, Airtight, Long Lasting,
Compliant, Simpler, Safer, Cost Saving, Quiet, Qualified, Low Impact, Sustainable, Competitive.

<h4>
<img border="0" src="img/2intelligent-1.JPG" width="205" height="199" align="left" hspace="18" vspace="6">Automated processing</h4>
IPP Architecturally engineered
blueprint data feeds automated
CNC processing machinery, for
precision cut output of timber
frame components and
connections. Solid wood is pre-cut,
stacked and air dried for quick
processing of size, length, detail
and species.

<h3></h3>
<h4>
Precision Panels</h4>
IPP Polyurethane foam panels
deliver impressive R-Values with
adhesive properties that penetrate
directly into the OSB or Magnesium
Oxide Board skins. This extremely
strong bond out performs lower
quality Polystyrene SIPS slabbed
with a separate adhesive that can
delaminate. Our IPP polyurethane
foam is free of CFCs, VOCs and
HFCs, resulting in one of the
greenest foams available today.

<h2>How Trinity is Integrating Eco-friendly Value</h2>
Next generation buyers appreciate the value of smart construction
technology, green building initiatives, energy conservation and safety
<h3></h3>
<h4>Deliver More Value</h4>
Trinity's Integrated Post and Panel
technology (IPP) combines the
aesthetic appeal and strength of
natural timbers, with performance
features of Structural Insulated
groove connections slip fit into and
over patented timber channels
increasing strength and energy
conservation. Assembling in record
time with precision accuracy, IPP's
building system will lead an
evolution of new construction
technology and deliver competitive
advantages to developers and
builders. 


<h3></h3>
<h4>Value added Performance</h4><p>
<b>R-Values.</b> At over R-7.5 per inch,
the IPP system exceeds the
newest building code regulations at
R28+ for 4.5-inch walls and R40+ for
6.5-inch roof panels, resulting in an
airtight home saving occupants
money and creating comfort.
<p>
<b>Polyurethane foam</b> has one of the
lowest moisture permeability
ratings of any product in the
building industry today. The
permeance rating is 1.2. No pests,
No allergens, No dust, No Mildew,
No Mold, No Off-Gasing or PCBs.
<p>
<b>Fire Resistance.</b> With a Class 1
rated foam, the highest rating a
building product can obtain,
polyurethane is not a source for
fire. On its own, it will not burn and
will extinguish itself. Polyurethane
is a thermal-set plastic, which will
not melt. At 1000 degrees it will
only char. An impressive 2 Hour fire
rating that provides extra time and
safety!
<p>
<b>Sound Proof.</b> IPP's Inert
Polyurethane foam has a density of
2.2 lbs. (twice that of EPS foam),
resists most chemicals, and
provides quiet comfort.
